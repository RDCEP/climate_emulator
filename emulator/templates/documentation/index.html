<h3>Statistical Emulation</h3>
<p>
  Statistical emulation of climate model output involves using a
  ‘training set’ of simulations for each model to fit the parameters
  of a simple statistical model that describes the climate response to
  changing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In the tool here, each region is fit
  separately.
</p>
<p>The training set used are archived GCM simulations made as part of the
  <a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/index.html">Coupled Model Intercomparison
  Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)</a>, and
  archived at the Earth Systems Grid database (available from various
  sites, including <a href="https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/home.htm">here</a>
  or <a href="http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov">here</a>). The simulations use CO<sub>2</sub>
  scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  5th Assessment Report. These ‘Representative Concentration
  Pathways’, or RCPs, describe the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations associated
  with various potential emissions scenarios (Figure 1 below). Where
  available, we use RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 as the training set.
  For some models that did not archive all scenarios, we use only
  RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.</p>

<p>
  For each model, also estimate the pre-industrial temperature for each
  model from its archived ‘historical’ simulation, as the average over
  the first 20 years (1850–1869).
</p>

<p>
  The statistical model used for emulation is described in detail in
  <a href="{{ url_for('emulator.static', filename='files/JCLI-D-13-00099.pdf') }}">Castruccio
  <i>et al</i> 2013</a>, with the only difference here being that we
  simplify the statistical model still further, omitting Castruccio <i>et
  al</i>’s beta1 term.
</p>

<p>
  All code (in Python) and parameters are publicly available through
  our Source page, under an LGPL license.
</p>

<p>
  In plots here, to facilitate comparison across models we normalize
  temperatures for each model and region to the multi-model mean for
  the period 1994–2004. For global temperature, we normalize to the
  NASA-GISS observed 1951–1980 global mean temperature of 14.0 C
  (57.2 F).
</p>

<h3>Models and regions</h3>

<p>We are currently emulating 13 models and are in progress on
  extending emulation to all CMIP5 models with sufficient archived
  data.
</p>
<p>The current version of the emulation tool can emulate
  BCC-CSM-1.1, CanESM2, CCSM4, CNRM-CM5, GISS-E2-R,
  HadGEM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR,
  MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM. </p>
<p>Of these models, four do not include RCP6.0 (CanESM, CNRM-CM5,
  MPI-ESM-LR, and MPI-ESM-MR).</p>
<p>We are extending the tool to include over 9 additional models:
  ACCESS-1.0, ACCESS-1.3, BNU-ESM, CESM1, CSIRO-Mk3.6.0,
  EC-EARTH, FGOALS, FIO-ESM, and various versions of the GFDL
  model.</p>
<p>Emulation is performed on regions at larger than native model
  resolution. For land areas, regions are chosen to follow national
  borders. Individual regions either lie within a single large country
  or contain groups of smaller countries. For a mapping of regions to
  countries, <a href="{{ url_for('emulator.documentation_regions') }}">see
  this table</a>.</p>

<h3 style="margin:45px 0 15px;font-weight:bold;">Running a user-specified CO<sub>2</sub> scenario</h3>

<p>We have included several scenarios as examples, including three
  for which GCM runs have already been completed and archived.
  However, the real purpose of an emulator is to generate projections
  for scenarios that have not yet been simulated by the larger models.
  Users can generate projections for arbitrary scenarios by uploading a
  text file of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>The file format is a comma-separated list of annual mean CO<sub>2</sub>
  concentrations, in parts per million (ppm), for each year, beginning
  with the year 2005. (For reference, pre-industrial CO<sub>2</sub> was believed
  to be about 270 ppm, and current CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is about 400
  ppm.) The list can be either a row or a column. In most browsers, the
  file can be uploaded simply by dragging over the upload box on the
  webpage. Users with older browsers may have to use the ‘choose
  file’ button.</p>
<p>Once the file is uploaded, the emulation tool will produce plots that
  show emulated model responses to the user-specified CO<sub>2</sub>
  scenario.</p>

<h3 style="margin:45px 0 15px;font-weight:bold;">Future developments</h3>

<p>Planned improvements to the emulator tool include</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin:15px 0 15px;padding: 0 0 0 1em;">
<li>Making emulation output available as text files</li>
<li>Adding more models (as described above)</li>
<li>Plotting GCM output along with emulations, for those scenarios
  where GCM output is available</li>
<li>Allowing user-controlled y-axis ranges to facilitate comparisons</li>
<li>Adding maps of temperature changes at any given time</li>
<li>Adding emulation of short-term climate variability</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome feedback, and suggestions. Please send comments to
  info-rdcep@ci.uchicago.edu</p>
